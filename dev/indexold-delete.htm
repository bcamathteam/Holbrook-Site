	<p>Upcoming Elections</p>
	</h3>

<p>Elections for the PPO Executive Board for the 2006-2007 school year will be 
held at the next General Meeting on Tuesday, May 23, 2006.</p>
<p>The Nominating Committee of the PPO has recommended the following slate of 
officers for one-year terms:</p>
<ul><li>President: Shiaoling Paxson</li>
<li>1st Vice President: Susan Bromberg</li>
<li>2nd Vice President: Lalitha Ramakrishnan</li>
<li>Treasurer: Hala Saardi</li>
<li>Corresponding Secretary: Brian Asserson</li>
<li>Recording Secretary: Parul Rawal</li></ul>
<p>Additional candidates may be nominated from the floor at the General Election 
and will be added to the slate at that time.</p>

<h3>PPO Bylaw Amendments</h3>
<p>At our April 11, 2006 General Meeting of the PPO, changes to the bylaws were 
presented to the membership in preparation for an amendment vote on May 23, 
2006. The PPO bylaws were last significantly revised in January 2000 and, in 
their current state, fail to reflect changes to the organization that have 
occurred since then. Our bylaws committee has worked tirelessly to examine and 
rewrite the bylaws to better serve today's PPO, and has incorporated two 
revisions ratified on April 11, 2006.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://academyppo.com/ppo/bylaws060523.doc">proposed new bylaws</a> 
and the <a href="http://academyppo.com/ppo/bylaws060411.doc">current version</a> 
are both available online for your review.</p>
<h3>PPO Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>Minutes from the PPO meeting of April 11, 2006 are <a href="/minutes/060411.doc">
available online</a>.</p>

<h3>PPO Newsletter</h3>
<p>The current <i><a href="/newsletter/0605.pdf">Connections</a></i> newsletter 
is the <a href="/newsletter/0605.pdf">May</a> issue, the last issue for this 
academic year.</p>

<h3>Scheduling Meeting Recap</h3>

<p>On Wednesday, March 1, the PPO hosted a meeting regarding the scheduling 
changes that had been proposed for next year. The PPO distributed to those in 
attendance a handout that summarized <a href="http://academyppo.com/minutes/scheduling.doc">
the rationale for the plan, and questions and concerns related to the 
implementation</a>. Additionally, <a href="http://academyppo.com/minutes/060301.doc">
PPO minutes of the meeting</a> have been posted in an attempt to keep the BCA 
community informed.</p>

 
<p>Mr. Aloia and his district administrative team announced on March 8th that 
the scheduling changes will not be implemented for the 2006-2007 school year, 
but that a task force with representatives from the BCA community will continue 
to explore the possibilities for the following year.</p>

parents' efforts: <a href="papa/index.shtml">The Performing Arts Parents 
Association</a>.</p>

<h3>AOL Users: Can You Hear Us Now?</h3><p>Some PPO members are finding the 
	spam-fighting features of recent editions of AOL can get in the way. If you 
	are using AOL 9.0, please add ppomail@academyppo.com to your address book. 
	Otherwise AOL will suspect PPO messages are spam by default.</p>

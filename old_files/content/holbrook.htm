<p><strong>Joseph Holbrook</strong></p>

<font color=#FFFFFF>Joe Holbrook was the original coach of the AAST Math Team, and led it from the school's founding in 1992 until his 2009 death. He remains an inspiration to us all, and we strive to live up to his idea that Math Team is not just for the best, but that all students have something to gain from competition math, and all students are welcome on our trips, whenever possible.</font></td>
